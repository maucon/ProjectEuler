Let n be a positive integer. Consider nim positions where:There are n non-empty piles.
Each pile has size less than 2n.
No two piles have the same size.
Let W(n) be the number of winning nim positions satisfying the above
conditions (a position is winning if the first player has a winning strategy). For example, W(1) = 1, W(2) = 6, W(3) = 168, W(5) = 19764360 and W(100) mod 1000000007 = 384777056.

Find W(10000000) mod 1000000007.
