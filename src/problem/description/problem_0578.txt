Any positive integer can be written as a product of prime powers: p1a1p2a2...pkak,
where pi are distinct prime integers, ai>0 and pi<pj if i<j.
A decreasing prime power positive integer is one for which aiaj if i<j.
For example, 1, 2, 15=35, 360=23325 and 1000=2353 are decreasing prime power integers.
Let C(n) be the count of decreasing prime power positive integers not exceeding n.
C(100)=94 since all positive integers not exceeding 100 have decreasing prime powers except 18, 50, 54, 75, 90 and 98.
You are given C(106)=922052.
Find C(1013).
