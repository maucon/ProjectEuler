Consider the natural numbers having at least 5 prime factors, which don't have to be distinct. Sorting these numbers by size gives a list which starts with:

32=22222
48=22223
64=222222
72=22233
80=22225
96=222223
  ...

So, for example, the fifth number with at least 5 prime factors is 80.


Find the millionth number with at least one million prime factors.  Give your answer modulo 123454321.
