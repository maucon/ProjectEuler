We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction. Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, R(12) = 411.
The resilience of a number d > 1 is then
(d)d  1
, where  is Euler's totient function.
We further define the coresilience of a number n > 1 as C(n)=
n  (n)n  1.
The coresilience of a prime p is C(p)
=
1p  1.
Find the sum of all composite integers 1 < n  21011, for which C(n) is a unit fraction.
