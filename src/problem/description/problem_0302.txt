A positive integer n is powerful if p2 is a divisor of n for every prime factor p in n.


A positive integer n is a perfect power if n can be expressed as a power of another positive integer.


A positive integer n is an Achilles number if n is powerful but not a perfect power. For example, 864 and 1800 are Achilles numbers: 864 = 2533 and 1800 = 233252.


We shall call a positive integer S a Strong Achilles number if both S and (S) are Achilles numbers.1
For example, 864 is a Strong Achilles number: (864) = 288 = 2532. However, 1800 isn't a Strong Achilles number because: (1800) = 480 = 253151.

There are 7 Strong Achilles numbers below 104 and 656 below 108.


How many Strong Achilles numbers are there below 1018?
