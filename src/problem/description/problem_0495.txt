Let W(n,k) be the number of ways in which n can be written as the product of k distinct positive integers.
For example, W(144,4) = 7. There are 7 ways in which 144 can be written as a product of 4 distinct positive integers:
144 = 12418
144 = 1289
144 = 12324
144 = 12612
144 = 13412
144 = 1368
144 = 2346
Note that permutations of the integers themselves are not considered distinct.
Furthermore, W(100!,10) modulo 1000000007 = 287549200.
Find W(10000!,30) modulo 1000000007.
