Consider the following variant of "The Chase" game. This game is played between  n  players sitting around a circular table using two dice. It consists of  n-1  rounds, and at the end of each round one player is eliminated and has to pay a certain amount of money into a pot. The last player remaining is the winner and receives the entire contents of the pot.
At the beginning of a round, each die is given to a randomly selected player. A round then consists of a number of turns.
During each turn, each of the two players with a die rolls it. If a player rolls a 1 or a 2, she passes the die to her neighbour on the left; if she rolls a 5 or a 6, she passes the die to her neighbour on the right; otherwise, she keeps the die for the next turn.
The round ends when one player has both dice at the beginning of a turn. The turn is aborted, that player is eliminated, and she has to pay  s^2  where  s  is the number of completed turns in this round. Note that if both dice happen to be handed to the same player at the beginning of a round, then no turns are completed, so the player is eliminated without having to pay any money into the pot.
Let  G(n)  be the expected amount that the winner will receive. For example  G(5)  is approximately 96.544, and  G(50)  is 2.82491788e6 in scientific notation rounded to 9 significant digits.
Find  G(500) , giving your answer in scientific notation rounded to 9 significant digits.
