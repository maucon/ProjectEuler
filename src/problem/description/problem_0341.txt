The Golomb's self-describing sequence  (G(n))  is the only nondecreasing sequence of natural numbers such that  n  appears exactly  G(n)  times in the sequence. The values of  G(n)  for the first few  n  are

\[
\begin{matrix}
n & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & \ldots \\
G(n) & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 5 & 5 & 5 & 6 & 6 & 6 & 6 & \ldots
\end{matrix}
\]

You are given that  G(10^3) = 86 ,  G(10^6) = 6137 .
You are also given that  \sum G(n^3) = 153506976  for  1 \le n \lt 10^3 .
Find  \sum G(n^3)  for  1 \le n \lt 10^6 .
